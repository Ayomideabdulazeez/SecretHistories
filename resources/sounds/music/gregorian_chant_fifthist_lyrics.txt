### AUTO-TRANSLATED LATIN
Quinque cogitationes irrationales,
Quinque radii fractae stellae,
Quinque elementa, quae spar-cula,
Quinque sensus ad mentem evocare,

Quinque frusta lente solvuntur.
Homines ad sidera caeli spectant.
Nos in aeternum tenebitur
caelestia corpora?

Numquam fuerunt, facere potes.
Sidera ut moiratur in tribus,
sed mundos mori in quinque.
Quaserer, quasars! Per sidera!

Envigilasti in Somnio?
Vivisne verbis?
Quid me primum portet,
purgans ad omnia edax?




### THE LORD'S ENGLISH, ABRIDGED
Think five irrational thoughts,
Five spokes of a broken star,
Five elements that forever spar,
Five senses to evoke the mind,

Five pieces slowly unwind.
Men look at a starry sky.
Will be forever be bound to
the celestial bodies?

They have never been, you can make it so.
Stars may die in threes,
but worlds die in five.
Quavering quasars! By the stars!

Have you awoken in the Dreaming?
Are you alive with the words?
What would reach me first,
purifying or all-consuming?
